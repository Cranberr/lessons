            <font color="green">I've learned a lot!</font> <p><u>Here is recap of some of the big ideas:</u>
            <p>
        1)  <em>The World Wide Web</em> commonly known as <b>WWW</b>, here <em>"The Web"</em>:
            <p>The Web is composed largely of HTML documents. <b>HTML</b> stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>
             and is the language the browsers use to interpret web pages such as <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>.
             <div>The components of The Web include: </div>
             <p>-<u>The Client</u>, i.e: your <b>computer</b> and <b>browser</b>
             <p>-<b>The Internet</b>
             <p>-<b>Servers.</b>
             <p>The Client and servers interact through something called the <span><em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em></span> <b>(HTTP)</b>
             <p>
        2)   <u>Basic HTML Elements:</u>
             <p>
             By using HTML elements we tell a web browser how to display content on a web page.<br>
             Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them.
             <p>
             <u>Here are some examples of very basic tags and what fun we can have with them:</u>
             <p>- using opening tag < b >(delete spaces) before any text and closing tag < /b >(delete spaces)
               after this text you will make this text go completly <b>bold</b>
             <p>- using opening tag < em >(delete spaces) before any text and closing tag < /em >(delete spaces)
               after this text you will make this text go completly <em>italic</em>
             <p>- by analogy, opening tag < u > and closing tag < /u > will make your text nicely <u>underlined.</u>
             <p>
             <font color="red"> Now we have tricky part:</font> <p>
        3)   <u>HTML Attributes:</u><p>
               Some elements accept additional values called attributes in their opening tags.
               Attributes give additional information to the browser. <div>
               For example, the anchor tag takes an attribute called href that defines a URL to link to:<p>
              <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> Creates a hyperlink to the href attribute value and names it Udacity<p>
              <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/5fa65c8c2585f629b9814fed5a802ef8/tenor.gif" alt="Hello">
                    Displays the image hosted at the src attribute value "url".
                    If the image cannot be displayed,
                    then the alt attribute value "text" is shown. <div>
               <font color="blue">In general computers are dummer than my cats unless we command them well.
               <p> As you can see by this presentation I will struggle a lot on the way to become programmer.
